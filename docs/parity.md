# Parity and versioning

Every wrapper, one surface, one version. This document is how that stays true
once it stops being convenient.

They all live in **this repo**, one directory per language, beside the contract
they implement. That is what makes the rest of this document enforceable rather
than aspirational: a change that touches the surface touches every lane in the
same diff, and CI runs all of them together before it can merge.

## The version is a shared fact

[`../VERSION`](../VERSION) is the single source of truth. Every wrapper's
manifest — `package.json` for node and cli, `pyproject.toml` for python — is
**written from** it during release, never edited by hand. If a manifest
disagrees with `VERSION`, the manifest is wrong.

Consequences worth accepting deliberately:

- **A wrapper releases even when it did not change.** If only the Python client
  needed a fix, all three still go out at the new version. The alternative —
  letting versions drift — means `@w6w/sdk@0.4.0` and `w6w==0.4.0` are different
  APIs, and every support conversation starts with archaeology. An empty release
  is cheap; a divergent one is not.
- **Semver applies to the surface, not to any one language.** A breaking change
  in any wrapper is a major bump for all of them.

Below `1.0.0`, breaking changes may land in a minor bump. That grace ends at
`1.0.0` — say so in each wrapper's README so nobody plans around it.

## Conformance

Each **contract lane** — `node`, `cli`, `python`, and any future language that
talks to `endpoints.json` directly — carries a conformance test that reads
`endpoints.json` and asserts the client exposes **every** operation in
`operations[]` — **regardless of its `status`** — under the name in that
operation's `naming` entry for its language. (Not every lane in this repo is a
contract lane — see below.) The mechanics of resolving a `naming` string to a
symbol or a CLI command are pinned in
[implementation.md §10](./implementation.md#10-conformance-runner); this section
and that one must agree, and that one is the newer, pinned spec.

The test asserts **existence and signature**, not behavior — it is a drift
alarm, not a substitute for the wrapper's own unit tests. What it catches is the
actual failure mode: an operation added to two wrappers and forgotten in the
third.

Not every lane in this repo carries this test, and the split has a name. A
**contract lane** — `node`, `cli`, `python` — implements every operation in
`endpoints.json` directly, appears in every operation's `naming` object, and
must have this test, green, with no exception. A **derived lane** — `react`, the
first one — composes an existing contract lane's already-conformant published
client instead of talking to `endpoints.json` itself, so it has no `naming`
entry to assert and carries no conformance test of its own; it still ships at
the same `VERSION` as everything else, because it only ever builds from a
contract lane's release, never from the contract independently. The missing
`naming.react` key is therefore not a gap the runner should have caught — it is
the shape of the category, and §Adding a language says the same for anyone
tempted to read it as a shortcut.

**`status` records _server readiness_, not wrapper obligation, so the runner
exempts nothing.** An operation is `"planned"` when its route is not live yet —
a statement about the **server**, aimed at a _user_ deciding whether a call will
reach anything today. It tells an _implementer_ nothing: this project implements
all of the operations ahead of the server, some of them `planned` only because
the server work is fenced. A wrapper that skipped an operation "because it is
planned" would ship a surface that silently differs from its two siblings, and
the drift would surface only when the fence clears — exactly the failure the
lockstep bet exists to prevent. Implement all of them, unit-test all of them
against a mocked transport, and assert all of them in conformance.

### Where the contract comes from in CI

From the checkout. There is nothing to fetch.

`endpoints.json` and `VERSION` sit at the root of **this** repo,
`w6w-io/w6w-wrappers`, one level above every lane — so `../endpoints.json` from
`node/`, `cli/` or `python/` is a plain sibling path in the same working tree,
in CI exactly as on a laptop. Every lane's conformance and version guard already
resolves it that way, from the test file's own location rather than the process
working directory.

This is the single largest thing the one-repo layout buys, so it is worth
recording what it replaced. When the wrappers were three separate public repos
and the contract lived in the **private** monorepo, no wrapper's CI could read
it — and the answer was not a private-monorepo PAT in a public repo. The plan
was a third repo, `w6w-io/w6w-contract`, mirroring two files and nothing else,
plus a monorepo job to push to it on every change and a fetch step in each
wrapper's `ci.yml`. That repo was never created and never needs to be: a mirror
is a copy, a copy goes stale, and the staleness would have been invisible
precisely when the contract changed. **Do not reintroduce it.**

Two rules survive the change, because they were never about the mirror:

- **Fail loudly, never skip.** If the contract or `VERSION` cannot be read, the
  job fails naming the path it looked for. All four guards behave exactly this
  way — `node/tests/version_test.ts`, `cli/tests/help_test.ts`,
  `python/tests/test_version.py` and `python/tests/test_surface.py` — and a
  guard that quietly passes when its input is missing is worse than no guard.
- **Never vendor a copy.** A committed copy of the contract inside a lane
  directory goes stale silently and defeats the whole mechanism — the same rule
  [implementation.md §10](./implementation.md#10-conformance-runner) pins. Every
  lane reads the one file at the repo root.

> **On the monorepo side**, this repo is attached at `packages/wrappers` as a
> submodule of the private `w6w` monorepo — the same treatment `packages/core`
> gets. A monorepo checkout therefore sees exactly the layout above; the
> submodule pointer is bumped in its own `chore(wrappers): bump submodule`
> commit after a change lands here.

## Adding an operation

The order is not negotiable, because each step depends on the previous one being
real:

1. **Server first — for `status`, not for the code.** The endpoint ships in the
   server, is deployed, and only then does its operation become
   `status: "required"`. That is what "wrappers never lead the API" means: no
   operation is ever _advertised as live_ before its route is, because a client
   method that silently returns 404 is worse than no method.

   It does **not** mean a wrapper waits. An operation whose route is not live
   yet goes into `endpoints.json` as `status: "planned"`, and is implemented in
   all three wrappers, unit-tested against a mocked transport, and asserted in
   conformance — exactly as §Conformance requires. `status` is the honesty
   mechanism that lets both rules hold at once: the **contract** records what
   the server can serve today, and the **wrappers** stay in lockstep regardless.
   This project is the live example — it implements the whole surface ahead of a
   server whose work is fenced, and marks what is not reachable yet.
2. **Contract second.** Add the operation to `endpoints.json`
   (`status: "required"`) and document it in `docs/endpoints.md` with its wire
   shape and per-language naming. Decide the naming _here_, once, rather than
   three times in three PRs.
3. **Every wrapper third — in one PR.** All lanes move together, in a single
   change against this repo, and conformance runs over every one of them in the
   same CI run. It cannot half-land.

   This used to be "one PR per wrapper repo", three PRs that had to be
   coordinated by hand and each of which was red until the others merged. That
   coordination _was_ the drift risk this document exists to manage: a fourth
   language would have made it four PRs, and the failure mode — an operation
   added to two lanes and forgotten in the third — was only ever caught after
   the fact, by a conformance run in a repo nobody was looking at. Now it is
   caught before merge, in the diff.
4. **Release together.** Bump `VERSION`, tag, ship ([release.md](./release.md)).

## Adding a language

A new language is **a directory in this repo** — `go/`, `dart/`, beside the
three that are here. Not a repo, not a CI bootstrap, not a new set of publish
secrets: a directory, a lane in the existing workflow, and a conformance test.

That is the whole point of the layout, and it is worth being explicit about what
it does _not_ make cheap. A wrapper is still a real commitment, because it makes
step 3 above wider forever: every future operation now has to be written a
fourth time, by someone who knows that language, on the same day. A wrapper that
lags a version behind is worse for its users than no wrapper at all — they will
reasonably assume it is current. The repo layout removes the _ceremony_, not the
obligation.

The bar for a new wrapper joining the lockstep:

- **Every** operation in `endpoints.json` implemented — `required` and `planned`
  alike, per §Conformance — and the conformance test green.
- Its own lane in this repo's CI workflow, running its gates on a path filter,
  and its own publish job on the shared release trigger
  ([release.md](./release.md)).
- Its manifest version written from `VERSION`.

`react/` sits in this repo without meeting this bar because it is a **derived
lane** (§Conformance), not a contract lane — it composes `node/`'s client rather
than implementing `endpoints.json` directly, and that exemption is react's
alone, not a precedent for a contract lane like a prospective `go/` or `dart/`.

Until all three hold **for a would-be contract lane**, keep it out of the
release workflow rather than shipping it half-joined — a derived lane like
`react/` was never bound by this bar to begin with, so it does not apply here.

## Token callback lanes

Contract 0.3.0 added a per-request token supplier, an opt-in one-shot `401`
recovery retry, an `onUnauthorized`/`on_unauthorized` callback, and client-wide
default `headers` (`docs/implementation.md` §2–§3,
[`sdk-surface.md` §1](./sdk-surface.md#1-construction-and-configuration)). This
is a **new axis the conformance runner does not and should not check** — none of
it is an _operation_, so it has no `naming` entry in `endpoints.json` and no row
in `operations[]`. It is recorded here instead, the way §Conformance already
separates "every operation, every lane" from everything else a lane legitimately
differs on (§6 of `sdk-surface.md`).

- **node and python both carry the callback; the CLI does not.** `W6WClient` and
  `Client` both accept `refreshOnUnauthorized`/`refresh_on_unauthorized`,
  `onUnauthorized`/`on_unauthorized` and a function-typed `token`. `@w6w/cli`
  does not: `cli/src/client.ts`'s `createClient` resolves a single static string
  token once, at startup, from a `--token`-flag-then-`W6W_TOKEN`-env precedence
  chain with no supplier anywhere in it — there is nothing for a `401` recovery
  attempt to call a second time, and a CLI invocation is already a single
  short-lived process a user re-runs by hand, which is a different
  failure-recovery story than a long-lived server process holding a client
  across many calls. This is a **deliberate, permanent exclusion**, not a gap to
  close later: adding it would mean inventing a CLI-side token-refresh UX (a
  hook with nothing to register it against) for a surface that has none of the
  host-process lifetime this feature exists for.
- **python's supplier is sync-only; node's may be sync or async.** R-1 (and
  `sdk-surface.md` §6): there is no `asyncio` anywhere in
  `packages/wrappers/python`, and its transport (`urllib`, blocking) has no
  async counterpart for a supplier to straddle. node's `TokenProvider` may
  return a `Promise`, which `request()` awaits before attaching the bearer;
  python's provider is called and used immediately. A python host with its own
  async token source resolves it _before_ handing the value to a sync callable —
  that resolution is the host's problem, not this package's, exactly like every
  other sync/async boundary `urllib` already draws for this lane.
- **`contractVersion` is unchanged, and `endpoints.json` is not touched at
  all.** `endpoints.json`'s `contractVersion` field tracks the **wire surface**
  — the operations, their shapes, their status — and this task changed none of
  them: `"auth": "bearer"` is still the only auth field any operation declares,
  and the new client options are not `operations[]` entries, so they have no
  `naming` object to add and nothing for a would-be fourth language to implement
  differently. A package-level `VERSION` bump for this change is a separate,
  later step (not part of landing this feature) — recorded here only to say that
  _this_ number, the contract's own, had no reason to move.

## Per-call cancellation (node only)

`CallOptions.signal?: AbortSignal` (R-7) is node-only, and deliberately not in
`endpoints.json`: it is a transport option on the _client_, not a parameter the
_server_ reads, so it does not describe the wire the way every other entry in
this contract does (the §Conformance test walks a built client and would have no
server-side shape to check it against). Every read method `@w6w/react`'s read
hooks call (`client.me`, `documents.list`/`get`/`getByKey`, `vars.list`/`get`,
`connections.list`, `workflows.list`/`get`, `functions.list`/`get`) accepts it,
forwarded to `src/http.ts`'s `request()` and from there straight to the injected
`fetch`'s own `RequestInit.signal` — never serialized into a query string or a
body.

**Python and the CLI have no analog, and this is not an oversight.** `signal`
mirrors a shape every JS runtime's own `fetch` already exposes (`AbortSignal`,
`AbortController`) — it is JS-idiomatic transport plumbing, not a capability the
_API_ grants. Python's `urllib`-based transport has no equivalent object to
thread one through, and a CLI invocation is a single short-lived process with
nothing in-process to cancel a call for — there is no "stale tab-switch request"
for either lane the way there is for a React hook re-rendering. Should a future
python transport (e.g. `httpx`) or a long-running CLI mode want the same thing,
it would need its own idiomatic mechanism (`httpx`'s own cancellation token, a
`SIGINT` handler) rather than a literal `signal` kwarg — unlike the lockstep
version bump (§The version is a shared fact), this axis is expected to stay
permanently node-only, not a gap pending a future PR.

## react's type-only edge onto `@w6w/ui`

`react/`'s `createW6WUiAdapter` targets `@w6w/ui`'s `W6WApi` contract
**structurally** — a hand-duplicated interface in `react/src/adapter.ts`, never
an import of `@w6w/ui` itself at runtime. `react/package.json` carries one
`devDependency` on it, `"@w6w/ui": "github:w6w-io/w6w-ui#<sha>"`, and that edge
is **dev-only and type-only**: `react/package.json`'s `files: ["dist"]` means
only `dist/` is ever packed and published, so no installer of `@w6w/react`
resolves `@w6w/ui` at all. Its one consumer is
`react/src/__tests__/ui-conformance.test.ts`, run by `npm test` at dev/CI time
only, which compiles a type-only check file against `@w6w/ui`'s real
`provider.tsx` and fails — naming the missing/mismatched member — the moment
`createW6WUiAdapter`'s return type stops being assignable to the real `W6WApi`.

**Why a `github:<owner>/<repo>#<sha>` pin and not a sibling `link:`:** this
repo's `release.yml` checks out **only `w6w-wrappers`** — no sibling checkout,
no submodules (§Conformance's own CI model is the same single-repo-checkout
premise). A `link:../../ui` resolves only by the local devcontainer's incidental
directory layout and fails `ENOENT` on every CI run and on a fresh standalone
clone; a `github:` spec needs nothing but a network fetch of the one pinned
commit. The pin targets `@w6w/ui/src/provider.tsx` by relative path rather than
the package's root barrel, because the barrel's own import chain reaches
`@w6w/expr` (`packages/core`) through a `github:…#path:` subpath npm does not
honor on a `github:` dependency — `provider.tsx`'s own closure (`theme.ts` →
`types.ts` → `react`) carries no such edge and compiles clean standalone.

This is **not** a second conformance axis alongside §Conformance's
`endpoints.json` runner above — `react/` is still a derived lane with no
`naming.react` entry and no obligation to implement `endpoints.json` directly.
It is a narrower, one-directional check that one derived lane's hand-duplicated
bridge interface has not silently drifted from the one third-party contract it
targets structurally; moving the pin (bumping the `#<sha>` to a newer
`w6w-io/w6w-ui` `main` commit and re-running `npm
install`) needs no `VERSION`
bump of its own unless `W6WApi` itself changed shape, in which case this check
is what says so.
